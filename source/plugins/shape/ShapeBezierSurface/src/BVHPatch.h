Acknowledgments:

The development of Tonatiuh was started on 2004 by Dr. Manuel Blanco,
at the time Chair of the Department of Engineering of the University of Texas
at Brownsville. From May 2004 to August 2008 Tonatiuh's development was
supported by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory (NREL) under the Minority Research Associate (MURA)
Program Subcontract ACQ-4-33623-06. During 2007, NREL also contributed to
the validation of Tonatiuh under the framework of the Memorandum of
Understanding signed with the Spanish National Renewable Energy Centre (CENER)
on February, 20, 2007 (MOU#NREL-07-117). Since June 2006, the development of
Tonatiuh is being led by CENER, under the direction of Dr. Blanco, now
Manager of the Solar Thermal Energy Department of CENER.

Developers: Manuel J. Blanco (mblanco@cener.com), Amaia Mutuberria, Victor Martin.
